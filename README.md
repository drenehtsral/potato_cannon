Various potato cannon related goodies

This repo contains an OpenSCAD design for a rifled slug to fit a bog standard potato cannon using a barrel made from 1 1/2 inch schedule 40 PVC pipe.
Mine uses a chamber made from a 4 inch PVC coupler with a 4-3 reducer and a 3 inch cleanout cap on the butt end and a 4-3 reducer followed by a 3-1.5 reducer on the barrel end.  I am using a gas BBQ grill piezoelectric igniter for a trigger and MAPP gas for the fuel charge (while the old AquaNet hair spray standby works well it tends to leave a sticky buildup over time that eventually interferes with the spark, and also the residual moisture makes repeated firings unreliable).
I also used PVC cement to fasten a short (~2cm) length of 1/2in
